# Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

These requirements apply to **all** NixFleet development work.

---

## NFR-1: Clarity Over Speed

**Do not take shortcuts when uncertain.**

- If something is unclear, **ask the user** before proceeding
- Don't guess at requirements or make assumptions
- When in doubt, clarify scope, behavior, or edge cases first
- Better to ask one question than fix three bugs

---

## NFR-2: Icons — No Emojis

**When working on UI elements (icons, buttons, labels), never use emojis unless explicitly told to do so.**

- Use SVG icons, icon fonts, or CSS-based icons
- Emojis render inconsistently across platforms and can look unprofessional
- If you need an icon and none exists, ask which icon library to use
- Exception: Only if user explicitly says "use emoji" or "emoji is fine"

## NFR-3: Responsive Design

**Always design for both extremes: mobile phones and large desktop displays.**

| Breakpoint | Target Devices | Considerations |
|------------|----------------|----------------|
| < 640px | Mobile phones (portrait) | Touch targets ≥44px, single column, collapsible sections |
| 640-1024px | Tablets, small laptops | Flexible layouts, may show more columns |
| > 1024px | Desktops, laptops | Full table views, side panels acceptable |
| > 2560px | 27" 5K displays | Don't stretch content infinitely, use max-width |

### Design Principles

1. **Mobile-first**: Start with mobile layout, enhance for larger screens
2. **Content hierarchy**: Most important info visible without scrolling on mobile
3. **Touch-friendly**: Buttons and interactive elements must be easily tappable
4. **Readable at scale**: Use `rem` units, respect user font preferences
5. **Max-width containers**: Prevent content from spanning full width on ultra-wide displays

### Testing Checklist

Before completing any UI work:

- [ ] Test at 375px width (iPhone SE)
- [ ] Test at 768px width (iPad portrait)
- [ ] Test at 1920px width (Full HD)
- [ ] Test at 2560px+ width (5K display)
