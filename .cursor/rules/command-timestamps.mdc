# Command Timestamps

## 🕐 CRITICAL RULE: Always Show Timestamp Before Long Operations

**ALWAYS** output a timestamp before running commands that are expected to take significant time (>10 seconds).

### ⏱️ Commands That Require Timestamps

- **Docker Operations**: `docker build`, `docker compose up`, `docker pull`
- **Python/pip**: `pip install`, `pytest` (large test suites)
- **File System**: `find`, `du`, `rsync`, `tar`, `cp -r` (large operations)
- **Development**: Package installations, test suites, database operations

### 📋 Implementation

Prefix long-running commands with `date &&` (or `date; and` for fish shell):

```bash
# ✅ GOOD
date && docker compose build

# ❌ BAD
docker compose build
```

**Shell-specific**:
- **Fish**: `date; and <command>`
- **Bash/Zsh**: `date && <command>`

### 🎯 Why This Matters

- **Tracking**: See when operation started in chat history
- **Debugging**: Correlate timing with other events
- **Planning**: Estimate duration for similar operations

### 🔔 AI Assistant Responsibility

Before running any long-running command:

1. **Assess**: Will this take >10 seconds?
2. **Add Timestamp**: Prefix with `date &&` (or `date; and` for fish)
3. **Combine**: Use single command line so timestamp and command appear together

**Special Cases**:
- **Multiple commands**: Add timestamp before each: `date && cmd1 && date && cmd2`
- **Background jobs**: `date && long-command &`
- **Remote commands**: `ssh server "date && command"`

> **When in doubt, add a timestamp!** Better to have an unnecessary timestamp than wonder when a long operation started.
