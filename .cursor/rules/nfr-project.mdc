# Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

UI requirements for NixFleet dashboard development.

---

## NFR-1: Icons — No Emojis

**Never use emojis in UI unless explicitly told.**

- Use SVG icons, icon fonts, or CSS-based icons
- Emojis render inconsistently across platforms
- If you need an icon and none exists, ask which library to use
- Exception: Only if user says "use emoji" or "emoji is fine"

---

## NFR-2: Responsive Design

**Design for mobile and large displays.**

Breakpoint          | Devices         | Key Points
--------------------|----------------|-------------------------------------------
< 640px             | Mobile         | ≥44px touch targets, single-column layout
640–1024px          | Tablet         | Flexible layout, adapt panels/tables
> 1024px            | Desktop        | Full table views, side panels enabled
> 2560px            | 5K+ Display    | Max-width containers, centered content

**Principles:**
- Mobile-first: start small, enhance for larger
- Touch-friendly: buttons easily tappable
- Use `rem` units for scalability

**Test at:** 375px, 768px, 1920px, 2560px

---

## NFR-3: Loading States

**Show progress during operations (switch, pull, test can take 30s+).**

- Never show frozen/unresponsive UI during operations
- Use spinners, progress bars, or skeleton loaders
- Indicate which operation is running and on which host
- Show elapsed time for long operations (>5s)

---

## NFR-4: Accessibility (Minimal)

**Basic keyboard and focus support.**

- All interactive elements focusable via Tab
- Visible focus indicator (outline/ring)
- Buttons/links have accessible labels (not just icons)
- Color alone shouldn't convey status (add text/icon)
