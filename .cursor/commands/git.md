## Git Commit and Push Guide

1. **Save** all open files.
2. **Stage** the files you want with
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   or an equivalent command.
3. **Commit** your changes:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   ```
4. **Push** the commit to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

> **IMPORTANT:**  
> Do **not** begin any new task or continue previous work unless the user explicitly instructs you to do so  
> (for example, by saying: `do /git and then implement this backlog item`).
