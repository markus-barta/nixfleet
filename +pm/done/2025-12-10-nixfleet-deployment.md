## What Was Done

### Dashboard Deployment

- [x] Dashboard deployed to csb1 via Docker Compose
- [x] Accessible at https://fleet.barta.cm
- [x] TOTP + password authentication working
- [x] Tokyo Night Plus theme applied

### Agent Deployment

- [x] NixOS module created: `modules/nixos.nix`
- [x] Home Manager module created: `modules/home-manager.nix`
- [x] Agents deployed on all reachable hosts:
  - csb0 ✅ (cloud)
  - csb1 ✅ (cloud)
  - hsb0 ✅ (home)
  - hsb1 ✅ (home)
  - imac0 ✅ (desktop)
  - gpc0 ✅ (confirmed working, now offline)
- [x] Hosts pending (not reachable):
  - hsb8 (remote network - parents' home)
  - mba-mbp-work (work laptop - needs token file)
  - imac-mba-work (work iMac - needs token file)

### Features Working

- [x] Host registration with metadata
- [x] Real-time status and heartbeat
- [x] Git hash version tracking with outdated indicator
- [x] Pull, Switch, Test commands
- [x] Git hash caching (avoids calling git every 10s)
- [x] safe.directory fix for root-owned git operations

### Secret Management

- [x] API token encrypted with agenix
- [x] Token deployed to all NixOS hosts via `age.secrets`
- [x] macOS hosts use `~/.config/nixfleet/token`

## Key Fixes During Deployment

1. **Git hash "unknown"** - Fixed by adding `-c safe.directory` to bypass ownership check when root accesses user-owned repo
2. **macOS PATH issues** - Fixed by explicitly adding `home-manager` to PATH in launchd config
3. **Host ID validation** - Fixed by using `hostname -s` for short hostname
4. **Caching** - Implemented git hash caching to avoid repeated git calls
